# MissionToMars

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.
In this project already designed 2 rocket prototypes, and I need to design and run simulations to decide which type to use.
